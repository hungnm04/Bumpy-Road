# Bumpy Road Project

Welcome to the Bumpy Road Project! This project is built using React.js, a JavaScript library for building user-friendly interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and is commonly used for building single-page applications.

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Download the project files.
3. Open the project folder in your code editor.
4. Open a terminal within your code editor.
5. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the development server by running the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev in client

   nodemon server.js for server

   admin account: admin
   password: adminpassword
   ```

This will start the development server and you can access the app in your browser at the specified URL.
